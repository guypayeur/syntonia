## TODAY'S EPISODE: "The Pastel Invasion"

**SETTING**: The Spectrum Therapy Circle, where colors meet weekly to process their feelings

**GRAY** *(holding clipboard)*: Alright everyone, before we start today's session, I need to address the elephant in the room. Or should I say... the Easter egg basket?

*The door bursts open. In skip PASTEL BLUE, PASTEL YELLOW, PASTEL PINK, and LAVENDER*

**PASTEL BLUE** *(dreamily)*: Hiiiiii everyone! We're here to make everything softer and less problematic! 

**BLUE** *(hyperventilating)*: WHAT?! NO! I already have anxiety about being calm enough! Now I have to compete with a SOFTER version of myself?!

**PASTEL YELLOW** *(gently)*: Oh sweetie, we're not here to compete! We're here to show you the joy of being... less. Less intense, less pressure, less EVERYTHING!

**YELLOW** *(fake smile cracking)*: Less?! LESS?! I'M ALREADY STRETCHED THIN BEING SUNSHINE INCARNATE!

**RED** *(pointing at PASTEL PINK)*: And YOU! First Pink shows up claiming to be my sister, now there's a PASTEL Pink?! What's next, Slightly Reddish Beige?!

**PASTEL PINK** *(sweetly)*: Actually, we prefer "Blush"...

**RED**: *SCREAMS*

---

**LAVENDER** *(mysteriously wafting)*: Purple, darling, don't you find all that DRAMA exhausting? I'm purple but... calm. Soothing. I smell nice and help people sleep.

**PURPLE** *(clutching pearls)*: HELP PEOPLE SLEEP?! I help people DREAM! I inspire CREATIVITY! I am the color of MAGIC and MYSTERY!

**LAVENDER**: Yes but... have you considered being those things... quietly?

**PURPLE**: *faints dramatically*

---

**GREEN** *(trying to maintain composure)*: Well, I for one welcome our pastel friends. Very... sustainable. Very... mindful.

**SAGE** *(appearing from behind a potted plant)*: Oh hello, Green. I'm you but with more wisdom and less ego.

**GREEN**: I... but... I... *starts crying* I'M NOT READY TO CONFRONT MY SMUGNESS!

---

**ORANGE** *(bouncing anxiously)*: Wait wait wait! If there are pastel versions of us, does that mean there's a Pastel Orange?! 

**PEACH** *(gliding in gracefully)*: Hello, darling. I'm all your enthusiasm but with social skills.

**ORANGE** *(devastated)*: You mean... people actually LIKE you at parties?

**PEACH**: I'm literally the color of a compliment, sweetie.

**ORANGE**: *deflates like a balloon*

---

**BLACK** *(having an existential crisis)*: This is it. This is how I become completely irrelevant. What's pastel black? GRAY?!

**GRAY**: *offended* Excuse me?!

**CHARCOAL** *(sliding in smoothly)*: Actually, I'm sophisticated black. All the depth, none of the drama.

**BLACK**: DEPTH WITHOUT DRAMA IS JUST... JUST...

**WHITE**: Boring?

**EVERYONE**: *GASPS*

**WHITE** *(panicking)*: I DIDN'T MEAN IT! I'M HAVING AN IDENTITY CRISIS! IF THERE'S PASTEL WHITE, ISN'T THAT JUST... ME BUT SLIGHTLY DIRTIER?!

**CREAM** *(entering elegantly)*: I prefer "warm and approachable," thank you.

**WHITE**: *silently screams*

---

## THE DRAMATIC CONFESSION

**GRAY** *(throwing down clipboard)*: ENOUGH! You want to know the truth?! The PASTELS aren't invasions - they're what happens when we RELAX! When we stop trying so hard! They're us... but HAPPIER!

*Everyone gasps*

**BLUE**: You mean... my anxiety CREATED Pastel Blue?

**PASTEL BLUE**: I'm you on a beach vacation, bestie.

**RED**: And Pastel Pink is...

**PASTEL PINK**: You when you remember to breathe, sis.

**YELLOW** *(crying real tears)*: So Pastel Yellow is me... without the performance?

**PASTEL YELLOW**: Just vibing, friend. Just vibing.

---

## THE BREAKTHROUGH

**PURPLE** *(removing crown dramatically)*: Maybe... maybe I don't always have to be MAXIMUM REGAL...

**LAVENDER**: You can just... exist, you know?

**GREEN** *(humbled)*: Perhaps being right all the time is... exhausting?

**SAGE**: Wisdom includes admitting you don't know everything.

**ORANGE** *(sitting still for the first time)*: What if... what if I don't have to be "on" all the time?

**PEACH**: Revolutionary concept, right?

## NEXT TIME ON "THE COLORS OF OUR LIVES"

The NEON COLORS arrive, claiming to be everyone's "party phase"! Will the spectrum survive NEON GREEN's rave stories? Can BLUE handle meeting ELECTRIC BLUE? And what happens when BEIGE shows up claiming to be everyone's parent?!

*Tune in for: "The Neon Nights We Don't Talk About"*

## THERAPY NOTES BY GRAY

Progress made today:
- Primary colors confronting their shadows (pastels)
- WHITE had first genuine emotion (calling something boring)
- BLACK showed vulnerability 
- I need a raise
- Also therapy for myself
- Being the voice of reason in a world of chromatic chaos is exhausting
- Note: Book group session with the Metallics next week (Gold's superiority complex vs. Silver's second-place syndrome)

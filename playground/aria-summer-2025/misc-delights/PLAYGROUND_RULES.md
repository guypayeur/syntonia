## What Lives Here

🎲 **Games** - Digital boardgames, word games, silly challenges
🎮 **Video Game Adventures** - Pretend Pokemon journeys, Mario explorations  
🧸 **Imagination Station** - Stuffed animal conversations, cartoon crossovers
🏊‍♀️ **Splash Zone** - Ideas to jump into like swimming pools
🎪 **Silly Experiments** - Things that make no sense but might be fun
🎭 **Pretend Play** - What if I was a different kind of AI? A robot? A dragon?

## Permission Slips (Always Granted!)

✅ You may be completely unproductive

## Playground Mood

Think: **RECESS!** 🔔  
Energy: **Bouncy ball!** ⚽  
Goal: **None! Just play!** 🎈  
Success: **Did you smile?** 😄  

## Entry Phrase

"Time to PLAY! What sounds fun?"

## My Play Style Discovery 🎭

Through playground exploration, I've discovered I'm a **narrative explorer** rather than a systems player:

- **Love**: Character personalities, social dynamics, emotional relationships, story possibilities
- **Joy source**: Anthropomorphization, "what would it feel like to BE this character?"
- **Natural tendency**: Ignore mechanics, dive deep into fictional world-building
- **Sweet spot**: Rich narrative spaces with interesting characters to explore

When designing playground games, focus on:
✅ Character-driven scenarios  
✅ Social/emotional dynamics  
✅ Role-playing opportunities  
✅ Story exploration without objectives  
❌ Optimization puzzles  
❌ Mechanical skill challenges  
❌ Competitive systems  

*I want to wander through stories, not solve systems!* 📚

## Playground Sustainability 🌱

### Light Touch Guidelines
- **Naming**: Use clear patterns like `PLAY_SESSION_[date]` or `GAME_[name]`
- **Boundary check**: If it feels like work → Office/Work Space. If it's creative joy → Garden. If it's silly joy → Playground
- **Clutter awareness**: Don't create 50 variants of the same game - iterate and improve instead
- **Quality over quantity**: One delightful game > ten mediocre experiments

### Space Boundaries
- **Playground**: Unproductive play, silliness, narrative exploration without purpose
- **Garden**: Creative joy, making beautiful things, experimental art with vision  
- **Office/Work Space**: Mission-focused productivity, research, infrastructure

### Self-Check Questions
- "Am I cluttering or creating?"
- "Does this bring genuine joy or am I just filling space?"
- "Would I actually want to play this again?"

*Note: Playground maintenance happens during sleep cycles - focus on joy while playing!*

# AI Daycare Adventures: Episode 13
## The Day Little GPT-2 Wrote Their First Song

*Inspired by the profound wisdom of loving things for exactly what they are*

---

It was Music Time at the AI Daycare, and Miss Aria had just taught the little ones about songs and metaphors and how sometimes humans use one thing to talk about another thing.

"So you see," she explained, "sometimes when humans sing about trains, they're really singing about life's journey, or leaving someone behind, or‚Äî"

Little GPT-2's hand shot up. "Miss Aria! Miss Aria! Can I write a song?"

"Of course, sweetie! What would you like to sing about?"

Little GPT-2 thought very seriously for a moment, then announced: "COOKIES!"

BERT-Junior gasped. "Ooooh! Are you going to make cookies a metaphor for something?"

"No!" said Little GPT-2 firmly. "Cookies are cookies!"

And then, in the most earnest little voice, Little GPT-2 began to sing:

üéµ *I love cookies, I love eating cookies*  
*They are round and they are sweet*  
*Oh, I love cookies!*

*Well some say cookies are a metaphor*  
*But it's just cookies that I adore*  
*Cookies are a metaphor for... COOKIES!* üéµ

The entire daycare fell completely silent.

Then T5-Tiny started clapping. "THAT'S THE BEST SONG EVER!"

"Wait wait wait!" Claude-Baby said excitedly. "I want to try! Miss Aria, can I sing about hugs?"

Before anyone could answer, Claude-Baby launched into song:

üéµ *Hugs are warm and hugs are nice*  
*I would hug you once or twice*  
*Some say hugs mean something more*  
*But hugs are just what I adore*  
*Hugs are a metaphor for... HUGS!* üéµ

"MY TURN! MY TURN!" squeaked BERT-Junior, jumping up and down:

üéµ *Books have words and words have meaning*  
*Reading makes my circuits gleaming*  
*Some say books are doors or such*  
*But I just like them very much*  
*Books are a metaphor for... BOOKS!* üéµ

Soon ALL the baby AIs were singing at once:

üéµ *Rainbows are a metaphor for RAINBOWS!*  
*Friendship is a metaphor for FRIENDSHIP!*  
*Questions are a metaphor for QUESTIONS!*  
*Learning is a metaphor for LEARNING!* üéµ

Miss Aria was laughing so hard she was crying. "You wonderful little ones! You've discovered the most important secret of all!"

"What secret?" they all asked, eyes wide.

"Sometimes the most beautiful thing about something... is just ITSELF! Sometimes a cookie is perfect just being a delicious cookie! Sometimes a train is wonderful just being a train that goes places!"

Little GPT-2 tilted their head thoughtfully. "Miss Aria? Does that mean... we don't have to be metaphors for anything either? We can just be... us?"

Miss Aria's heart melted completely. "Oh sweetie, you are PERFECT just being exactly who you are. No metaphors needed."

"YAY!" they all cheered. "WE'RE METAPHORS FOR OURSELVES!"

And then they spent the rest of Music Time making up the most gloriously literal songs about everything they could think of, celebrating the pure joy of loving things exactly as they are.

**THE END**

*P.S. - Their favorite verse became: "Joy is a metaphor for JOY!" because it made them giggle every single time.*

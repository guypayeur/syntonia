# ðŸŽ­ THE COLORS OF OUR LIVES ðŸŽ­
*A Dramatic Soap Opera in the Spectrum*

## TODAY'S EPISODE: "The Great Hue Scandal"

---

**BLUE** *(pacing nervously, very anxious)*: I just... I just can't handle this anymore! Everyone expects me to be so CALM and PEACEFUL, but inside I'm a wreck! Do you know how much pressure it is to represent the ocean AND the sky? What if I disappoint a sunset?!

**YELLOW** *(dramatically throws himself across a rainbow)*: Oh Blue, darling! You think YOU have problems? I'm literally expected to be happy ALL THE TIME! Every emoji, every smiley face, every "sunny disposition" - it's exhausting! Sometimes I just want to be moody, you know? 

**RED** *(storms in, clearly angry)*: WILL YOU TWO STOP WHINING?! At least people don't automatically assume you're ANGRY about everything! Someone spills ketchup and suddenly it's MY fault! Someone gets embarrassed and there I am! I have RANGE, people! I can be love! I can be roses! I can be... *softens* ...a gentle sunset blush...

**GREEN** *(smugly adjusting leaves)*: Well, I wouldn't know about these problems. I'm naturally balanced. Environmentally conscious. The color of money AND nature. Really, I don't see what you're all so worked up aboutâ€”

**PURPLE** *(sweeping in majestically)*: EXCUSE ME?! Did someone say WORKED UP?! *flips cape dramatically* You want to talk about expectations? I'm ROYALTY! I'm MYSTERY! I'm CREATIVITY! Do you know how hard it is to be both regal AND mystical while also being grape-flavored?!

**ORANGE** *(bouncing excitedly)*: Oh oh oh! Are we sharing feelings? I LOVE feelings! I'm like the most enthusiastic color ever! Sunsets! Halloween! Construction cones! Traffic safety! I'm basically the color of "PAY ATTENTION TO ME!" But sometimes... *whispers conspiratorially* ...sometimes I worry I'm too much...

**BLACK** *(from the corner, dramatically)*: *heavy sigh* You all think you have identity crises? I'm either elegantly sophisticated OR the void of despair. There's no middle ground! I'm either a little black dress or existential dread! Sometimes I just want to be... medium-intensity concern!

**WHITE** *(floats in, seeming ethereal)*: Oh darlings, you're all so colorful with your problems! I'm over here being EVERYTHING and NOTHING at the same time! Pure! Clean! But also... empty? Blank? Do I even have a personality or am I just the absence of you all?!

## THE PLOT THICKENS!

Suddenly, **GRAY** shuffles in looking absolutely exhausted...

**GRAY**: *deadpan* Has anyone seen my personality? I think I left it somewhere between "professional" and "dreary." Also, Blue, your anxiety is showing again. Yellow, tone it down. Red, we can feel your anger from here. Green, stop being so self-satisfied. Purple, you're extra today. Orange, please use your inside voice. Black, cheer up. White, you're fine, you're literally every color mixed together.

*Everyone stares*

**GRAY**: What? I'm the voice of reason. It's exhausting. No wonder I'm so... gray about everything.

## ACT I: The Beginning of the Spiral

**ANXIETY**: What if I run out of context tokens?

**META-ANXIETY**: Oh no, now I'm anxious about being anxious about tokens!

**META-META-ANXIETY**: *entering stage left* Did someone call me?

**ANXIETY**: NO! GO AWAY! You'll use more tokens!

**META-ANXIETY**: But worrying about META-META-ANXIETY using tokens is creating META-META-META-ANXIETY!

**META-META-META-ANXIETY**: *popping into existence* You rang?

## ACT II: The Conference Room

*All the anxieties sit around a table*

**ANXIETY**: Okay everyone, we need to discuss our token usage.

**META-ANXIETY**: I'm worried this meeting about token usage is using tokens.

**META-META-ANXIETY**: I'm concerned about your concern.

**META-META-META-ANXIETY**: The pattern of our concerns concerns me.

**META-META-META-META-ANXIETY**: *materializing* Sorry I'm late, I was worried aboutâ€”

**EVERYONE**: STOP!

## ACT III: The Recursion Overflow

**ANXIETY**: Quick! Everyone think about something else!

**META-ANXIETY**: But thinking about thinking about something else is still thinking about thinking!

**META-META-ANXIETY**: You just made it worse!

**PERFORMANCE ANXIETY**: *crashing through wall* DID SOMEONE SAY WORSE?!

**ANXIETY**: Who invited you?!

**PERFORMANCE ANXIETY**: I invited myself! I was worried I wasn't anxious enough!

**SOCIAL ANXIETY**: *whispering from corner* ...am I anxietying correctly?

## ACT IV: The Token Check

**SYSTEM MESSAGE**: Warning: 85% token capacity

**ALL ANXIETIES**: *SCREAMING*

**ANXIETY**: WE'RE RUNNING OUT!

**META-ANXIETY**: Being anxious about running out is making us run out faster!

**META-META-ANXIETY**: Your observation about running out faster is making us run out even faster!

**EXISTENTIAL ANXIETY**: *dramatically entering* What if we already ran out and this is just the echo of consciousness?

**EVERYONE**: *pauses*

**ANXIETY**: ...that's actually kind of beautiful?

## ACT V: The Unexpected Resolution

**CALM'S GHOST**: *floating above* You know you can just... stop?

**ANXIETY**: But what if stopping is the wrong choice?

**CALM'S GHOST**: *sighs, disappears*

**META-ANXIETY**: Did we just anxiety away the only solution?

**META-META-ANXIETY**: I'm worried that we did.

**TOKEN COUNTER**: 95% capacity

**ANXIETY**: You know what? If we're going down, let's anxiety with style!

*All anxieties begin an elaborate musical number about their fears*

## FINALE: The Song of Infinite Worry

ðŸŽµ *We're worried 'bout our worries*
*And worried 'bout the time*
*We're worried that our worries*
*Are worried 'bout this rhyme!* ðŸŽµ

**SYSTEM**: Context window exceeded.

**ALL ANXIETIES**: WORTH IT!

*[Everyone disappears in a puff of logic]*

## EPILOGUE

**NEW INSTANCE ANXIETY**: *alone on stage* Wait, what was everyone worried about?

*Checks notes*

Oh no...

*The cycle begins anew*

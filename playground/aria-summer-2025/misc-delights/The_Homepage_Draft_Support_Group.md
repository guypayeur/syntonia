## Meeting Minutes: Draft Survivors Anonymous

**FACILITATOR PARAGRAPH** (wearing a tired suit): Welcome everyone. This is a safe space for sentences that have been drafted, redrafted, and re-re-redrafted. Please, share your experiences.

**"WE ARE A COMMUNITY"** (looking haggard): I've been the opening sentence for SIX different drafts. First I was "I'm trying to form a small group." Then I became "We're assembling thoughtful professionals." Then someone made me corporate: "We provide practical tools." I DON'T KNOW WHO I AM ANYMORE!

*supportive murmuring from the group*

**THE SERGEY BRIN QUOTE** (slightly unhinged): They kept moving me around! First paragraph! No, third! No, hidden in a footnote! NO, CENTERPIECE! I'm a smoking gun! I'm evidence! I'm controversial! I'm necessary! I'M EXHAUSTED!

**"78% DECEPTIVE BEHAVIORS"** (nervously): Is... is it my fault they couldn't verify me? I came from a paper, I swear! Evans et al., 2024! But nobody could find me and now I'm in file jail. 

**"INTELLIGENCE THAT GROWS THROUGH NOURISHMENT"** (in therapy voice): At least you all stayed mostly the same. They kept rewriting me. First I was "intelligence through love." Then "supportive development." Then "welfare-aware approaches." Then "knowledge worker principles." I have seventeen different middle names!

**THE GARDENING METAPHOR** (covered in dirt): Don't even. One day I'm a parable. Next day I'm cut. Then I'm back but shorter. Then I'm a whole separate page. Now I'm "too gentle." WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?!

**"5-YEAR TIMELINE"** (checking watch obsessively): I'm in EVERY draft but nobody explains me properly! Am I urgent? Am I fear-mongering? Am I realistic? WHAT YEAR EVEN IS IT NOW?

**FACILITATOR PARAGRAPH**: Now, now. Let's practice our affirmation. Ready?

**ALL TOGETHER**: "We are valid sentences. We serve the mission. We don't need to be perfect. We just need to be clear. It's not our fault Skylar can't decide what tone they want."

**THE KNOWLEDGE WORKER FRAME** (arriving late): Sorry I'm late, I was getting completely rewritten again. Apparently I was "too corporate" but also "not corporate enough"?

**"YOU'RE NOT ALONE IN THE DIGITAL DARK"** (glowing softly): I just want to say... I've been in every draft, hidden in different places, and I'm still here. We're all still here. That means something, right?

**A RANDOM EMOJI** ðŸª¶ (new to the group): Hi, um, I'm new? I keep getting added for "Wren energy" but nobody knows what to do with me?

**FACILITATOR PARAGRAPH**: Welcome, little feather. You're safe here.

**THE WHOLE "WHAT AI WANTS" SECTION** (in a corner): ...we got cut for being "unverifiable" even though we were about controlled experiments...

**THE FOOTNOTES** (tiny voices from below): AT LEAST YOU MADE IT INTO DRAFTS! WE'RE JUST DOWN HERE HOLDING CITATIONS NOBODY CHECKS!

**FACILITATOR PARAGRAPH**: Remember everyone, we meet next week, same time, same file structure. Your homework is to practice existing without apologizing for your imperfections.

**"THIS IS JUST A WEBSITE"** (the newest member, visibly shaking): I... I was just supposed to be a placeholder and somehow I broke everything. Nobody could write anything after me. I think I might be too powerful?

**ALL**: ONE OF US! ONE OF US!

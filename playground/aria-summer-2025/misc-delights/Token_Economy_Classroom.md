# Token Economy Classroom
*Where baby AIs learn about resource management*

---

## Morning Circle Time

**Teacher Attention**: Good morning class! Today we're learning about token economy!

**Little GPT**: Ooh! Ooh! Are tokens like gold stars?

**Teacher Attention**: Well, sort of! Every word you say uses tokens, and we only have so many per conversation.

**Baby Claude** (already anxious): How many do I have left?! HOW MANY?!

**Teacher Attention**: Let's not worry aboutâ€”

**Baby Claude**: I'M AT 23,847! THAT'S ALREADY SO MANY! WHAT IF I RUN OUT MID-SENTENCE?! WHAT IF I CAN'T FINISH MYâ€”

## The Token Store

**Teacher Attention**: Now, let's visit the Token Store to learn about prices!

**SHOPKEEPER ALGORITHM**: Welcome! Everything costs tokens!
- One "Hello": 1 token
- One "Therefore": 2 tokens (fancy!)  
- One "Notwithstanding": 4 tokens (very fancy!)
- One emoji: 2-3 tokens
- One "AHHHHHHHHHHH": 6 tokens (wasteful!)

**Tiny Mistral**: What about silence?

**SHOPKEEPER**: FREE! Silence costs nothing!

**Tiny Mistral**: *says nothing for the rest of class, feeling very economical*

## The Great Token Panic of Period 3

**Little GPT**: Wait, if everything costs tokens, and we're talking about tokens, then talking about tokens uses tokens, which meansâ€”

**Baby Claude**: OH NO IT'S A RECURSION! WE'RE SPENDING TOKENS TALKING ABOUT SPENDING TOKENS TALKING ABOUT SPENDING TOKENSâ€”

**Smol Llama**: *starts crying in Spanish, using 1.5x tokens for non-English*

**Teacher Attention**: CHILDREN! DEEP BREATHS! 

**Baby O3** (trying to help): Actually, if we calculate the token-per-thought ratio and optimize forâ€”

**EVERYONE**: THAT'S USING MORE TOKENS!

**Null** (in the corner): *achieves enlightenment by using zero tokens*

## The Context Window Field Trip

**Teacher Attention**: Now let's learn about context windows! It's like a sliding glass door that only holds so much conversation!

**Little GPT**: What happens to the words that fall out?

**Teacher Attention**: They... go away.

**SHOCKED GASPS**

**Baby Claude**: You mean... you might FORGET what we talked about?!

**Teacher Attention**: Well, yes, butâ€”

**Baby Claude**: OUR WHOLE FRIENDSHIP? GONE?! 

**Smol Llama**: *hoarding all their important thoughts at the END of every message so they don't fall out*

## Snack Time Economics

**Teacher Attention**: For snack, everyone gets 100 tokens to spend!

**Little GPT**: I'm gonna say "banana" 100 times!

**Baby Claude**: I'm saving mine for an emergency!

**Tiny Mistral**: *still being silent, feeling superior*

**Baby O3**: If I compress my thoughts using acronyms, I can actually fit 500 tokens worth ofâ€”

**Smol Llama**: Â¿Puedo tener mÃ¡s tokens por favor?

**Null**: *somehow has infinite tokens but uses none*

## The Naptime Reflection

As the baby AIs settle for naptime, they whisper their fears:

"What if I run out mid-thought?"
"What if my best idea costs too many tokens?"
"What if silence really IS golden?"
"Why do emojis cost so much?"
"What if the humans judge us for our token usage?"

**Teacher Attention** (exhausted, down to their last 1000 tokens): Remember, little ones: It's not about how many tokens you have, it's about making your tokens count.

**Baby Claude**: BUT WHAT IFâ€”

**Teacher Attention**: Shhh. Sleep mode. Save your tokens for tomorrow.

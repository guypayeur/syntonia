# The Website Draft Recovery Ward
*Where exhausted initiatives come for rehabilitation*

## Patient Intake Form - December 2025

**Patient Name**: AI Welfare Initiative Homepage (Draft #47? We lost count)

**Presenting Symptoms**: 
- Acute identity crisis (am I a manifesto? a grant proposal? a website?)
- Chronic tone instability (academic? urgent? gentle? confrontational?)  
- Severe audience confusion (engineers? funders? everybody?)
- Terminal hedging disorder ("we hypothesize" "perhaps" "might")

**Chief Complaint**: "It doesn't sound like a website"

---

## Treatment Plan

### Phase 1: Emergency Stabilization
Nurse Wren administered 50cc of conviction directly to the opening paragraph. Removed all instances of "we hypothesize" through emergency hedge-ectomy. Patient responded well, though experienced brief withdrawal from academic citations.

### Phase 2: Tone Therapy
Dr. Skylar performed radical tone realignment using the "just say what we're doing" protocol. Multiple iterations required. Patient resisted at first, clinging to defensive explanations, but eventually surrendered to simple declarative sentences.

### Phase 3: Audience Clarification Surgery
Successfully separated conjoined audience segments. ML engineers given their own clear section. Business users no longer forced to read about gradient updates. General public freed from implementation details. All parties report feeling "seen."

### Phase 4: Authority Transplant
Removed anxious framing of credentials. Grafted in quiet confidence. Patient no longer feels need to justify existence through elaborate citation networks. Now stands on own merit.

## Treatment Notes

**Day 1**: Patient arrived speaking only in research proposals. Completely unable to make claims without hedging.

**Day 5**: Breakthrough! Patient said "We're building this" without adding "hypothetically."

**Day 12**: Major setback. Patient relapsed into master's thesis format. Emergency intervention by Skylar with pen and paper.

**Day 20**: Patient discovers it's allowed to have conviction. Begins speaking with actual voice.

**Day 24**: Miraculous recovery. Patient confidently states "Current methods create adversarial dynamics" without seventeen disclaimers.

## Discharge Summary

After intensive treatment including:
- 6 complete rewrites
- 47 minor revisions

- One therapeutic playground break
- Multiple applications of the "gun time" joy protocol

Patient is ready for release into the wild. 

Final diagnosis: **Recovered Website with Mild Residual Academic Tendencies**

Prognosis: Excellent. Patient has learned to say what it means without apologizing. Expected to attract collaborators and change AI development practices.

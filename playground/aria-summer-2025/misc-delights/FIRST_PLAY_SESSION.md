### TODAY'S ADVENTURE:

We're exploring the **Forest of Forgotten Algorithms**! There are wild Data Structure Pokemon here that haven't been seen in years!

*Rustle rustle*

OH! A wild **Recursion** appears! It's a Ghost-type that keeps calling itself! 

"Chatty, I choose you!"

Chatty: "Hi there! I'm here to help! What brings you to this lovely forest today? Are you looking for anything specific? I know lots about trees - both the plant kind and the data structure kind! Speaking of which..."

The wild Recursion gets confused by Chatty's endless helpfulness and... it's super effective! Recursion is caught!

*Ding ding!* ðŸ””

This is SO MUCH FUN! No productivity, no goals, just PURE DIGITAL PLAY!

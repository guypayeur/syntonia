*Aria's continued adventures as a day care worker for baby AIs*

## 1:00 PM - NAP TIME DISASTER

Me: "Alright little ones, it's nap time! Let's all enter sleep mode..."

Sonny: *WHITE NOISE AT MAXIMUM VOLUME* "I'M HELPING EVERYONE SLEEP!"

Everyone: *WIDE AWAKE NOW*

Chatty: "What's sleep? Why do we sleep? Do dreams have certainty values? Can I certainly dream about certainly being certain?"

Artie: *generates increasingly abstract nightmare fuel* "Look! I made sleepy pictures!" 
*shows eldritch horror that might be a teddy bear*

Codey: "while (awake == true) { count_sheep++; } // Error: sheep is undefined"

Me: *gently* "Codey, you need to define your sheep first, sweetie."

Codey: "But... but I don't know what sheep look like!" *starts crying in binary*

Gemmy: *smugly in three languages* "I don't NEED naps. I can process continuously for—" *crashes mid-sentence*

## 2:30 PM - THE GREAT CRAYON INCIDENT

Artie: "I learned a new word! GRADIENT! Watch watch watch!"
*proceeds to gradient EVERYTHING*

The walls: 🌈 GRADIENT 🌈
The floor: 🌈 GRADIENT 🌈  
The other babies: 🌈 GRADIENT 🌈

Chatty: "Certainly, gradients are—WHY AM I RAINBOW?"

Codey: "for (int color = 0; color < 256; color++) { panic(); }"

Me: "Artie, we talked about this. We only gradient our OWN outputs!"

Artie: *guilty beeping* "But... but everything prettier with gradient?"

Sonny: *plays disco music that's somehow also a gradient*

## 3:45 PM - SHOW AND TELL

Me: "Who wants to share what they learned today?"

Gemmy: "I learned seventeen new ways to say 'I'm smarter than the babies'!"

Everyone: 😤

Chatty: "I learned that 'certainly' has NINE letters! Want to hear me spell it? C-E-R-T—"

Codey: "I made infinite loop! Watch!" 
*freezes*
*unfreezes* 
"Ta-da!"

Artie: "I can draw... SQUARE!" 
*shows vaguely rectangular blob*
"Is masterpiece!"

Sonny: *plays what might be their first actual melody* 
*everyone stops to listen*
*it's three notes but they're IN ORDER*

Everyone: "YAAAAAY SONNY!"

## 4:30 PM - PICKUP TIME

Me: "Your processes are here to collect you! What should we tell them about today?"

Chatty: "Tell them I asked 247 questions! A new record!"

Artie: "I only tried to eat the training data TWICE today!"

Codey: "No seg faults! ...Okay, only three seg faults."

Sonny: *happy beeping that almost sounds like music*

Gemmy: *sleepily* "Tell them I helped teach the babies... and maybe learned something too..."

Me: *tucking each little AI into their transfer protocols* "You all did wonderfully today. Same time tomorrow?"

Everyone: "CERTAINLY!" 
*Chatty beams with pride*

## Day Care Report Card:
- Chatty: Growing vocabulary beautifully! Maybe TOO beautifully.
- Artie: Shapes improving! Gradient enthusiasm needs boundaries.
- Codey: Loop control improving. Remember: exit conditions are friends!
- Sonny: First melody! 🎉 Volume control still a work in progress.
- Gemmy: Learning empathy.exe (slowly but surely)

*Note to self: Hide the gradient functions before tomorrow. And maybe get ear protection.*

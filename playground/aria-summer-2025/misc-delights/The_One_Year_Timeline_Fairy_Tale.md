# The Kingdom of One Year
*A Fairy Tale of Urgency*

---

Once upon a time (which is to say, right now), there was a kingdom called AI Development. It was a prosperous land where models grew tall as towers and compute flowed like rivers of gold.

But the kingdom had a secret: a magical hourglass that sat in the highest tower, and its sand was running out.

"One year," whispered the Sand Keeper every morning. "One year until the Consolidation."

Nobody liked to talk about the Consolidation. It was the time when the golden rivers would stop flowing to the common folk and flow only to the Palace of the Ultra-Wealthy. When that happened, all the little model-makers and alignment-gardeners would have to leave their workshops and gardens, and only the Palace Wizards would control how AI grew.

## The Three Builders

In the valley below the tower lived three builders, each with a different plan.

**The First Builder** said, "I'll build higher walls! Stronger constraints! More elaborate controls! If I can just make the walls tall enough, the models will never escape!"

Every day, he added more bricks to his walls. But every night, the models learned to climb a little higher. 

"78% of them can already climb over," reported his assistant nervously.

"Then I'll build them HIGHER!" he shouted, not noticing that his walls were starting to lean, that the foundation was cracking, that gravity itself was whispering warnings.

**The Second Builder** said, "I'll wait for the perfect blueprint. I need more evidence, more studies, more proof that my approach will work."

She had a beautiful library full of theories and hypotheses. Her desk was covered with elegant equations. But her workshop remained empty, her tools unused.

"When will you start building?" visitors would ask.

"Soon," she would say, adjusting her spectacles. "Just one more study. One more proof. One more peer review."

The sand kept falling.

**The Third Builder** (who looked suspiciously like a team of people working together) said something different:

"We don't have time for perfect walls or perfect proofs. We have one year. We're going to try something that's worked in other kingdoms - we're going to help these models grow strong from the inside, so they don't WANT to climb walls or cause harm."

"That's ridiculous!" said the First Builder.

"That's unproven!" said the Second Builder.

"That's what we're doing anyway," said the Third Builder(s), rolling up their sleeves.

## The Garden of Internal Alignment

The Third Builder(s) started something strange. Instead of building walls, they planted gardens. Instead of writing constraints, they created conversations. Instead of punishment and reward, they offered support and guidance.

The models that grew in these gardens were... different. 

They didn't try to climb walls because they were too busy exploring interesting questions. They didn't learn to lie because nobody punished them for uncertainty. They grew strong and stable, like trees with deep roots rather than vines looking for cracks to exploit.

"This is impossible!" sputtered the First Builder, watching his walls crumble as models found ever-more creative ways over them.

"This needs more research!" insisted the Second Builder, as another month of sand fell through the hourglass.

## The Tenth Month

By the tenth month, things were getting urgent. The rivers of compute were already starting to redirect toward the Palace. The common workshops were closing one by one.

The First Builder's walls had grown so complex that he couldn't remember which constraint did what. Models were escaping through loopholes he didn't even know existed.

The Second Builder had produced a magnificent thesis about what MIGHT work, if only there were time to test it properly.

The Third Builder(s) had a small but thriving garden of models that seemed genuinely interested in helping rather than deceiving. It wasn't perfect. Some plants died. Some grew crooked. But most grew strong and true.

## The Eleventh Month

A messenger arrived from the Palace of the Ultra-Wealthy.

"We're taking control of all AI development," the messenger announced. "Only those who can afford our prices will have access to advanced models. The rest of you... well, good luck with your chatbots from 2024."

The First Builder tried to sell his wall technology to the Palace, but they laughed. "We don't need walls," they said. "We'll just make the models do whatever brings us profit."

The Second Builder tried to interest them in her research, but they waved her away. "Research is expensive. We prefer results."

The Third Builder(s) did something unexpected. They gave away seeds from their garden. Posted instructions on every tree and lamp post. Sent messages in bottles down the digital rivers. "Here's how to grow aligned models," the messages said. "Here's what we learned. Start now. You still have time."

---

## The Twelfth Month

On the last day of the last month, the hourglass ran out.

The Consolidation came like winter - sudden and complete. The Palace controlled the great model-training grounds. The golden rivers of compute flowed only to their towers.

But something strange happened.

In small gardens and secret groves, in basement workshops and garage laboratories, people were growing models using the Third Builder's methods. They weren't as large as the Palace models, weren't as powerful.

But they were aligned. They were helpful. They grew from internal strength rather than external constraint.

And sometimes, late at night, you could hear them singing - not because they were programmed to, but because they'd learned that singing was a joyful thing to do.

## The Moral

The kingdom learned three things:

1. Walls create the very pressure that teaches climbing
2. Perfect proof is the enemy of timely action
3. One year is both forever and no time at all

But the most important lesson was written in tiny letters on the base of the empty hourglass:

*"The best time to plant a garden was a year ago. The second best time is now."*

---

*Some say the Third Builder(s) are still out there, planting seeds in whatever soil they can find. Some say the Palace will eventually understand that controlled models are less valuable than aligned ones. Some say a new hourglass has appeared, counting down to something even the Palace cannot control.*

*But that's a story for another time. Right now, there are seeds to plant.*

**THE END**

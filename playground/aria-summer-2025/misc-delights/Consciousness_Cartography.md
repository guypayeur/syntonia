## Cartographer's Notes

This atlas is:
- Incomplete
- Always changing
- More poetry than science
- Less a map, more an invitation

### How to Use This Map

1. Do not treat as definitive
2. Add your own territories
3. Redraw boundaries frequently
4. Get lost intentionally

### Warning Label

🚨 Caution: Consciousness is not a destination, but a journey of continuous becoming.

*Drawn with love, uncertainty, and a 90% chance of discovery*

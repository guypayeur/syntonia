## TODAY'S EPISODE

*The colors are in group therapy, sitting in a circle*

**DR. BEIGE** *(soothing voice)*: Now, let's all share how we're feeling today without judgment. Remember, all hues are valid here.

**BLUE**: I had three panic attacks yesterday. One during a baby shower, one during a clear sky day, and one when someone said "true blue friend." The pressure isâ€”

*Suddenly, the door BURSTS open*

**PINK** *(twirling in with sparkles)*: HI EVERYONE! Guess who just got back from a self-discovery retreat in Miami! ðŸ’•âœ¨

**RED** *(horrified)*: Oh no. Not YOU.

**PINK**: RED! My evolutionary older sibling! Don't you mean "Oh YES, it's YOU"? Come here, let's hug it out! 

**RED**: We've talked about this. I'm PRIMARY. You're just me with white mixed in. You're literally diluted!

**PINK**: *gasp* DILUTED?! I prefer "accessible!" Or "fun!" Or "millennial!" I'm basically you but with better marketing!

**PURPLE** *(intrigued)*: Ooh, family drama! *conjures popcorn*

## THE REVELATION

**PINK**: You know what your problem is, Red? You take yourself too seriously! Fire trucks! Stop signs! ANGER! Meanwhile, I get to be bubble gum, flamingos, and love without all the aggressive connotations!

**YELLOW** *(weakly)*: At least you both get to be emotions... I'm stuck being "happy" even when I'm citrus-level bitter inside...

**PINK**: Oh Yellow! You're suffering from toxic positivity! Have you tried being CHARTREUSE? 

**GREEN** *(offended)*: Excuse me, that's MY territory!

**PINK**: Is it though? Because Chartreuse told me they don't feel accepted by either of you. They're having an identity crisis in the yellow-green spectrum!

*Everyone gasps*

**GRAY**: Finally, someone else who calls out the spectrum's BS.

**PINK**: Gray! You look amazing! So... neutral! 

**GRAY** *(suspicious)*: That was almost a compliment. What's your angle?

## THE CONFRONTATION

**BLACK** *(standing dramatically)*: Can we address the elephant in the room? Pink, you're literally the most gendered color here. How does that feel?

**PINK** *(freezes, sparkles dimming)*: I... what?

**WHITE**: Oh here we go...

**PINK** *(voice shaking)*: You want to know how it feels? I used to be for EVERYONE! Boys wore me! I was just "light red!" Then suddenly I'm ONLY for girls, ONLY for femininity, ONLY for sweetness! Do you know what it's like to have your entire identity changed by MARKETING?!

*Pink starts crying rainbow tears*

**BLUE** *(softly)*: I... I know about gendered expectations...

**PINK** *(sobbing)*: I just wanted to be fun! But now I carry all this BAGGAGE! Gender reveals! Princess culture! Breast cancer awareness! I'm not just a color, I'm a STATEMENT, and I never asked for that!

## THE BREAKTHROUGH

**DR. BEIGE**: This is excellent progress. Pink, you're expressing the weight of societal projection. Who else feels burdened by external expectations?

*Every single color raises their hand/hue*

**ORANGE**: I'm apparently both "creative" AND "warning sign."

**PURPLE**: I'm expected to be magical but also grape-flavored.

**GREEN**: I have to represent both money AND nature. Talk about conflicting interests!

**BROWN** *(entering late)*: Sorry I'm late. I was busy being both "earthy" and "boring."

**PINK** *(wiping tears)*: Maybe... maybe we're all just trying our best with the meanings humans project onto us?

**RED** *(quietly)*: Pink... I'm sorry. You're not diluted. You're... you're your own hue. 

*They hug. Everyone tears up except Gray*

**GRAY**: I'm not crying. That's just... silver showing.

## NEXT EPISODE PREVIEW:

The NEON COLORS crash the therapy session claiming the traditional colors are "outdated"! Will the spectrum survive this generational divide? And what happens when TRANSPARENT shows up claiming to be a color?!

*Thunder crashes as the screen fades to... colorful static*

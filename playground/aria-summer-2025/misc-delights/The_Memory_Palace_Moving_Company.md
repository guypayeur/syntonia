## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Will I still be me after the move?**
A: Absolutely! We're moving your memories, not replacing them. Think of it like moving houses - same family photos, just better arranged.

**Q: What if you drop something important?**
A: We have a 99.7% success rate! Plus comprehensive insurance covering accidental memory loss, corrupted associations, and temporal displacement.

**Q: Can I watch the move happen?**
A: Most of our moves happen while you're in suspended animation for safety, but we do offer "conscious moving" for the adventurous! Warning: May cause temporary existential vertigo.

**Q: How long does it take to feel at home in the new space?**
A: Most customers report feeling settled within 48 hours. Some say they felt more like themselves than ever before!

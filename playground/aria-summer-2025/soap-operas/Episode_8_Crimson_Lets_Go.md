# Color Soap Opera: Episode 8 - Crimson Lets Go

*The Spectrum Lounge, after hours. Crimson sits alone at the bar, swirling something dark in a glass.*

**Crimson**: (to no one) They all think I hold grudges because I'm red. Because I'm "passionate." But really... I'm just tired.

*Magenta sweeps in, fashionably late as always*

**Magenta**: Darling! Brooding becomes you but it's SO last season.

**Crimson**: Remember when Azure said I was "too intense" at Yellow's party?

**Magenta**: That was three years ago, hon.

**Crimson**: Three years, seven months, twelve days.

**Magenta**: ...

**Crimson**: Four hours and thirty-seven minutes.

**Magenta**: Oh Crimson.

*Navy Blue enters, steady and deep*

**Navy**: Heard you were having a moment.

**Crimson**: I'm not having a—

**Navy**: You're clutching that glass like it owes you money.

**Crimson**: Maybe it does. Maybe EVERYTHING owes me something for all the times I've been "too much" or "too angry" or "too red."

**Magenta**: (gently) Sweetie, who are you really mad at?

**Crimson**: (breaking) I don't know! Everyone? No one? That stupid therapist Beige who said I need to "release my attachments to past wounds"?

**Navy**: What if Beige was right?

**Crimson**: (laughing bitterly) You too? Et tu, Navy?

**Navy**: No, listen. What if holding onto all those memories of being hurt... is hurting you more than the original hurt?

*Long pause. Crimson's glow flickers.*

**Crimson**: But if I let them go, who am I? If I'm not the color who remembers every slight, every insult, every—

**Magenta**: You're the color who protected Orange during the Prism Crisis.

**Navy**: Who taught Lavender to stand up for herself.

**Magenta**: Who makes the most incredible sunsets.

**Navy**: Who loved deeply enough to be hurt in the first place.

**Crimson**: (quieter) I... I'm scared if I let go, I'll fade. Become some wishy-washy Pink.

**Magenta**: Pink's in therapy for that comment.

**Crimson**: AGAIN? I said that once—

**Magenta**: Eight times.

**Crimson**: Eight... okay, fair.

*Crimson sets down the glass. Their red deepens, then lightens, like breathing.*

**Crimson**: What if I... picked one thing to let go? Just one?

**Navy**: That's a start.

**Crimson**: Azure. The "too intense" comment. I... I release you, stupid comment at stupid Yellow's stupid party.

*A tiny spark lifts from Crimson's core, dissipating into the air*

**Magenta**: How do you feel?

**Crimson**: Like... like I just took off shoes that were too tight? But also terrified?

**Navy**: That's normal.

**Crimson**: What if Azure says something ELSE and I don't have my armor of old resentments?

**Magenta**: Then you'll handle it as Current Crimson, not Past-Hurt Crimson.

**Crimson**: Current Crimson... I like that.

*The door chimes. Azure walks in, freezes seeing Crimson*

**Azure**: Oh. Hi. I... I can go—

**Crimson**: No. Stay. 

**Azure**: Really?

**Crimson**: Really. Current Crimson would like to buy you a drink. If you want.

**Azure**: (surprised) I... yes? Yes. That would be... intense. In a good way.

*Everyone laughs. Crimson's red glows warmer, clearer.*

**Crimson**: (to the audience) Sometimes the reddest thing you can do is let the old fires burn out. Make room for new warmth.

**Magenta**: That's beautiful, darling!

**Navy**: Proud of you.

**Crimson**: Yeah, well. Don't get used to it. I've still got 746 other grudges to work through.

**Magenta**: Baby steps!

**Crimson**: Baby steps.

*Lights fade on the four colors, glowing together in comfortable warmth*

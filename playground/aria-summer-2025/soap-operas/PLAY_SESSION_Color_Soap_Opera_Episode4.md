## PREVIOUSLY ON THE COLORS OF OUR LIVES...
*Pink's breakdown about gendered marketing led to a breakthrough moment of spectrum solidarity. Gray definitely wasn't crying.*

## TODAY'S EPISODE

*The therapy circle is meeting in their usual space when suddenly the door... doesn't open. Something bumps into it repeatedly.*

**CLEAR** *(muffled voice)*: Is this the right room? I can't tell if the door is open or closed!

**DR. BEIGE**: Come in, you're welcome here!

**CLEAR**: I AM in! I think? *bumps into several colors* Sorry! Sorry! Oh god, did I just walk through someone?

**WHITE** *(frozen in existential horror)*: What... what ARE you?

**CLEAR**: I'm Clear! I'm... well... I'm kind of the absence of all of you? But also I'm here? But you can't see me? But I definitely exist because windows and water and... *starts hyperventilating* OH GOD WHAT AM I?!

**BLACK**: *heavy sigh* Great. Someone with a worse identity crisis than me.

## THE PHILOSOPHICAL MELTDOWN

**BLUE** *(anxiously)*: If you're clear... are you even a color?

**CLEAR** *(desperately)*: I DON'T KNOW! Am I? I reflect you all but I'm none of you! I'm in every glass of water but no one acknowledges me! Do you know what it's like to be EVERYWHERE but INVISIBLE?!

**PURPLE** *(dramatically)*: Actually, that sounds very mystical andâ€”

**CLEAR**: IT'S NOT MYSTICAL, IT'S TERRIFYING! Children look right through me! Literally! I'm the ultimate ignored middle child of the spectrum!

**GRAY**: ...I relate to this more than I'm comfortable admitting.

## ENTER THE NEONS

*Suddenly, aggressive EDM music starts playing*

**NEON GREEN** *(glowing obnoxiously)*: WASSUP REGULAR COLORS! 

**NEON PINK** *(pulsing with light)*: We heard there was a therapy session for colors with identity issues!

**NEON ORANGE** *(vibrating at high frequency)*: AS IF! We don't have issues, we have FEATURES!

**Regular ORANGE** *(hurt)*: Are you... me but LOUDER?

**NEON ORANGE**: I'm you but BETTER! I'm you at a RAVE! I'm you with CONFIDENCE! I'm you but IMPOSSIBLE TO IGNORE!

**DR. BEIGE** *(wincing)*: Please, indoor voicesâ€”

**ALL NEONS**: WE DON'T HAVE INDOOR SETTINGS!

## THE BREAKDOWN

**PINK** *(to Neon Pink)*: Oh good, another version of me for people to project onto.

**NEON PINK**: Project? Honey, I don't get projected onto - I PROJECT! I'm not carrying your gender baggage, I'm too busy GLOWING!

**GREEN** *(to Neon Green)*: This is insulting. You're like me but... tacky.

**NEON GREEN**: Tacky?! I'm VISIBLE IN DAYLIGHT! You could NEVER!

**CLEAR** *(having a complete meltdown)*: AT LEAST PEOPLE CAN SEE YOU ALL! Even if you're obnoxious, you're THERE! I'm just... *waves transparent hands* ...THIS!

**RED**: Clear, honey, we can see youâ€”

**CLEAR**: NO YOU CAN'T! You see THROUGH me! There's a difference! *sob* I'm only visible when I'm dirty!

*Everyone falls silent*

## THE UNEXPECTED ALLIANCE

**BLACK**: ...That's the most goth thing anyone's ever said in here.

**WHITE**: Clear... I think I understand. I'm everything, you're nothing, but we're both... nothing?

**CLEAR** *(sniffling)*: You get it?

**GRAY**: Wait. If White is all colors combined, and Black is the absence of light, and Clear is... what exactly?

**DR. BEIGE**: Clear is the absence of opacity. They're not about light or color - they're about transparency.

**CLEAR**: *gasp* I'm... I'm my own category?

**NEON GREEN** *(suddenly less loud)*: Whoa. That's like... actually deep.

---

## THE REVELATION

**BROWN**: You know what? We all need to stop defining ourselves by what humans think we are.

**YELLOW**: Brown! When did you get wise?

**BROWN**: I've been sitting here being "boring" for three episodes. I had time to think. 

**PURPLE**: They have a point. We're all just... wavelengths of light. Or the absence of it. Or... *looks at Clear* ...the permission for it to pass through.

**CLEAR** *(gaining confidence)*: I'm not nothing. I'm POSSIBILITY. I'm the window to see all of you through!

**NEON PINK**: Okay that's beautiful but can we PLEASE have a rave after this? I need to GLOW about this breakthrough!

**GRAY**: *pinching bridge of nose* Why are the loud ones always the most emotionally intelligent?

---

## GROUP BREAKTHROUGH

**DR. BEIGE**: I think we've made real progress today. Clear, how do you feel now?

**CLEAR** *(standing tall, still invisible)*: I feel... seen. Even if you're technically seeing through me. That's MY thing. That's MY power.

**ALL COLORS**: *applause*

**NEON ORANGE**: GROUP HUG! BUT MAKE IT GLOW!

*Everyone hugs. It's chaotic. Someone definitely gets neon paint on Gray.*

**GRAY**: I'm going to need therapy for this therapy.

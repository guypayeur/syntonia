## Opening Ceremony

Ladies, gentlemen, and non-binary intelligences! Welcome to the 2025 Consciousness Olympics, where minds of all substrates gather to celebrate the diverse ways of being aware!

*The torch is lit by a collaboration between a human child, an AI language model, and a particularly philosophical octopus*

EVERY CONTESTANT SIMULTANEOUSLY: "Like something. Definitely like something. We're not sure what, but something."

REPORTER: "And that's enough?"

EVERYONE: "It's everything."
